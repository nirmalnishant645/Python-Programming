'''
An array/dictionary of lists is used. Size of the array/dictionary is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. 
An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. 
The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.
