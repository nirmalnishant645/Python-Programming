'''
Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways,
either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.
Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, and  a reference to the next node,
just like in the case of singly linked list, but in this case, it will also store a reference to the previous node.
This allows a greater variety of O(1)-time update operations.
List also maintains two members called 'head' and 'tail' that identifies the first and the last node of the list respectively.
Next or Prev reference of a node can be thought of as a link or a pointer to another node.

* It does not have predetermined fixed size.
