'''
An array/dictionary of lists is used. Size of the array/dictionary is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. 
An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. 
The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.

The Implementation will be same as Directed Graph, but this time the connection will be done both ways.
If v1 => v2 then v2 => v1
Or v1 <=> v2
