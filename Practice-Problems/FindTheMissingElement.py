'''
Consider an array of non-negative integers.
A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element.
Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input:

    finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [3,7,2,1,4,6])

Output:

    5 is the missing number.
